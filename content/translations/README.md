# Translation files

English stories and blogs live in `content/articles` and `content/blogs`. A translation uses the same filename in `content/translations/<language>/articles` or `content/translations/<language>/blogs`. The frontmatter needs translated `title`, `excerpt`, and `tags`, plus a `sourceHash` of the English title, excerpt, and trimmed Markdown body. The Markdown body is the complete translation. Shared IDs, dates, image paths, and citation URLs come from the English file during the build.

Supported language codes: `hi`, `bn`, `ta`, `te`, `mr`, `ur`, `gu`, `kn`, `ml`, `pa`, `es`, `fr`, `ar`, `zh`, `pt`.

Each language also needs a `site.json` object mapping every English interface and history-data string to its translation. `npm run check-translations` reports missing or stale story/blog files and the number of missing `site.json` entries. The selector exposes a language only when its complete site, story, and blog translations pass the build checks. Book titles and book descriptions remain in their published language.
