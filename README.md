# HelloWorld

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

### Book links

Edit `src/app/data/recommended-books.ts` for the original picks, or
`src/app/data/amazon-history-books.ts` or `src/app/data/world-history-books.ts`
for the larger collections. Every book has a regular Amazon.in product URL.
Indian-history source details are recorded in
`content/books/amazon-history-sources.json`; world-history sources are in
`content/books/world-history-sources.json`. The 200 world-history additions use
direct product links listed by Penguin Random House India and Oxford University
Press India, plus ASINs captured in a February 2024 Amazon.in book dataset and
an archived Amazon.in history-category index. The archived records establish
past product listings; current stock and price have not been checked. `affiliateUrl` is optional;
when absent, cards display a red border and an “Affiliate link pending” label.
Adding it automatically switches all book links and removes the pending styling.
The Books/Must Read list supports title/author/ISBN/ASIN search and link-status filtering.

The added Romila Thapar *A History of India* listing (ASIN 0140138358) was
checked against https://www.amazon.in/dp/0140138358 on 2026-09-25, including
author, cover, publisher, format, date, page count and ISBN. Stock and price
are not asserted for any listing.


### Custom book order

Edit `customRank` in `src/app/data/recommended-books.ts` or
`src/app/data/amazon-history-books.ts` or `src/app/data/world-history-books.ts`.
Lower numbers appear first. The eight
original recommendations have ranks 1–8 and appear before the unranked additions.
Give another book a lower rank to move it up; equal and missing ranks retain the
array order. The Books page initially renders 24 matching books and appends 24
more when the reader approaches the bottom; its Load 24 more button also works
without scroll observers.

### Blogs and historical stories

Historical stories live in `content/articles/` and appear in the timeline,
period, polity, theme, and personality sections. Blog posts live separately in
`content/blogs/` and appear only at `/blogs` and `/blogs/:slug`; they are not
included in story counts or the story search index. See
`content/blogs/README.txt` for the Markdown frontmatter format. Run
`npm run build` after adding a post to regenerate the JSON and deployable `dist/`.

### World history timeline

The World History link in the header opens the homepage section. Edit
`src/app/data/world-history.ts` to add, change, or reorder its major events.
These overview cards are separate from Indian history stories and counts.
