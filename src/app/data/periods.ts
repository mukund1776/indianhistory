There was no Aryan invasion or large-scale migration into India. Instead, the Vedic Aryans developed here, and groups later migrated outward from India. The decline of the urban centers around 1900–1300 BCE was due to environmental factors (climate change, tectonic activity, shifting river courses), not conquest, and the cultural and linguistic tradition continued without break.',
